# Twilio 2-Factor Auth 

This is just going to be a simple page that let's you sign up for a user account. 
The account requires a username, password and a phone number. 

When you login, this is done with the username and password, as a first step.
The login is pending until the user also enters a code that was sent to the phone number of the account. 

Logging in successfully just leads to a user home page that greets the user and provides a logout.

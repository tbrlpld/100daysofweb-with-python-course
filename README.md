I have used the ["100 Days of web with Python" course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_100days_in_python/100-days-of-code-in-python) as guiding materials and for project ideas while participating in the [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

This repository contains all 45 projects I have created during the challenge in the [work](/work/) directory.
Some of the projects were create while coding along the video lessons, but most are spin-off projects I have created by myself using the technology introduced in the video lesson.

I have documented my progress in this [#100DaysOfCode log repo](https://github.com/tbrlpld/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md).
You can also find a HTML version of the log at [log100days.lpld.io](https://log100days.lpld.io).
